title: Getting Partnered with the Marketplace!
body: |
    Getting partnered with marketplace is a _privilege_ not a _right_. There is no guarantee that your application will be accepted, especially if you don't have a strong portfolio. Even if you _are_ accepted, you should be prepared to wait for at _least_ a few months, and realistically you may never be accepted.

    **How to build a portfolio**
    - Release maps on the Internet
    - Release maps through a publisher
    - Have a meaningful, well organized, public image
    - Register as an actual company
