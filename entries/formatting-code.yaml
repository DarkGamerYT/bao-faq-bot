title: Formatting Your JSON Or JS Code
body: |
    Please format your code as code-blocks! This makes the text monospaced, and has support for syntax highlighting.

    **JSON**
    \`\`\`json
    {
        "example": 123
    }
    \`\`\`

    **JavaScript**
    \`\`\`js
        console.log("Hello World");
    \`\`\`

    The character used here is the **backtick**. This symbol is usually at the top left of your keyboard, occupying the tilde key (~). On mobile, it will be on the second or third page of symbols.
