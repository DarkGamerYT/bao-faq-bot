    Placement passes can just be thought of as a named ordering for when placement of a feature rule's target feature should occur.
    *Nothing special occurs during a pass; it's just a name.*
    The available passes are:

    - `pregeneration_pass`
    - `first_pass`
    - `before_underground_pass`
    - `underground_pass`
    - `after_underground_pass`
    - `before_surface_pass`
    - `surface_pass`
    - `after_surface_pass`
    - `before_sky_pass`
    - `sky_pass`
    - `after_sky_pass`
    - `final_pass`

    NoteL `pregeneration_pass` is reserved for carver features.
