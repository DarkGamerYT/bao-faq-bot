title: Using the `development_*_packs` folders
body: |
    The correct way to create addons is by using the `development_behavior_packs` and `development_resource_packs` folders. Storing your addons here will allow you to reload the world to see addon changes, and will prevent pack caching issues.

    You can work directly in the world, or in `behavior_packs`/`resource_packs`, but you need an understanding of manifest-versions and caching to avoid issues.

    We highly recommend using the `development_*_packs` folders.
