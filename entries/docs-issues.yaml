title: bedrock.dev issues
body: |
    Bedrock.dev is built upon existing documentation provided by Minecraft. It is pretty much impossible to maintain this documentation, since whenever a new version releases, mojang deletes all the old documentation and replaces it with the new version. Any edits we make are erased.

    Things like missing components, mislabeled queries or even outdated information is not the fault of destruction, and is rather the fault of Mojang.

    We are looking into making documentation fixes persistent, but until that happens there is nothing we can do.
