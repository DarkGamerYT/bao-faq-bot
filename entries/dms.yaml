title: DMs Are Not Ideal
body: |
    When you ask a question via DM, you are restricting the total number of people who can help you from all potential server members to just *one*. Asking in the public channels is the best way to get a good, community-sourced answer to your question, allowing other observers to give their input.

    While you are certainly welcome to DM with each other, please be aware it is against our rules to send unsolicited DMs requesting help.
